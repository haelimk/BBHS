                              The English Department of Bishop Brady High School believes in fostering an environment for mutual discovery through teacher/student exploration of the spirit, culture, and history of the individual and the human family through reading, research, discussion, and writing. We recognize that the ability to communicate effectively requires the development of forms of expression which include thinking, reading, writing, listening and speaking skills.<br> We provide a four-year course of study designed to address the needs and potential of our students and to encourage students to accept responsibility for their education and to participate actively in creating an intellectual environment that will foster their development as scholars and independent thinkers.

                                The goal of the Language Department is to develop proficiency in the four language skills: listening comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. At the same time, we seek to teach students to understand and respect the cultural and societal differences of the people of the languages being studied, whether modern or ancient. We promote student exchange programs, travel, field trips, and guest speakers to expose the students to the culture and people of the target language. This also allows the students to better understand and appreciate their own language and culture and enable them to develop a global perspective.

                                Throughout their coursework, students will also encounter cross-curricular learning projects and other opportunities that encourage students to interact with people from within the global community. Ultimately, the goal of the Social Studies Department is to help students form the tools that will help them succeed, not only in the classroom, but as a citizen as well.</p>

We recognize that many fields of study and prominent employment opportunities require a solid foundation in mathematics. Whether students have an interest in computer technology, forecasting, environmental science, engineering, business management, public policy, pharmaceutics, or medical technology, each motivated and talented student is provided a rigorous background in the study of mathematics.<br>

                              Bishop Brady students are challenged to develop a working knowledge of the mechanics and applications of mathematical-based systems involving various real world conditions. The curriculum is Algebra-based rooted in Cartesian principles and practice, with major emphasis on two-variable data analysis and modeling. Students will discover, define, and understand relationships among numbers and variables to demonstrate patterns, to write equations, and to evaluate functions. </p>

                    Bishop Brady is committed to identifying and promoting partnerships with local organizations that extend academic opportunity beyond the classroom and foster service learning and community cohesion.<br>
 
                    Additionally, Bishop Brady is continually expanding opportunities for students to demonstrate leadership, consistent with the school’s vision of developing young people of faith, learning, service and excellence.
                    <br>
                    Bishop Brady’s academic program reflects the school’s commitment to cultivating individual student growth in learning, growth in service to others and growth in his or her faith. This growth starts in an environment that nurtures talents and supports struggle.
                    <br>
                    The curriculum offers students a wide range of course choices in subjects suitable for college preparatory study. A Bishop Brady education provides an environment where students can question, explore, analyze and communicate effectively and respectfully.
                    <br>
                    We encourage you to look through the offerings in our Program of Studies. We encourage our students to pursue their interests, push themselves to new challenges and open their minds to the belief that education and faith is a life-long journey. Their high school education is a major step in that journey.
